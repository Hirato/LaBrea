.SH DESCRIPTION
.B labrea
creates virtual machines for unused IP addresses in the specified
block of IP addresses.  LaBrea sits and listens for ARP "who-has"
requests.
.LP
When an ARP request for a particular IP goes unanswered for
longer than its "rate" setting (default: 3 seconds), labrea crafts an
ARP reply that routes all traffic destined for the IP to a "bogus" MAC
address.  labrea sniffs for TCP/IP traffic sent to that MAC
address and then responds to any SYN packet with a SYN/ACK packet that
it creates.
.SH OPTIONS
.B labrea
accepts the following options:
.TP
.BI "-i --device " interface
By default, labrea uses the first ethernet interface. This forces
labrea to use the specified interface.
.TP
.BR  "-n --network " xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx[/nn]
labrea normally pulls information about the netblock from the IP
information assigned to the interface.  If labrea is run on an
unconfigured interface (one without an assigned IP address), then use
this option to specify the subnet to be captured.
.RS
.LP
.I xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
is the network address.
.I /nn
is the subnet mask in CIDR notation. If the subnet mask is not
specified here, then you must include the -m parameter.
.RE
.TP
.BR  "-m --mask " xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Another way to specify the network mask for the capture netblock. If
this parameter is specified, then the -n parameter must also be
specified.
.TP
.BR "-t --throttle-size " \fInn\fR
Sets the TCP window advertisement
to limit the amount of data sent to labrea. The number of data
bytes to allow per packet is 
.I nn
bytes.
.TP
.BR "-p --max-rate " \fIrate\fR
Connect attempts will be permanently captured by forcing the
connection into a "persist" state (by closing the TCP window). In this
state, the connection will not time out.  labrea will permanently
capture connect attempts up to maximum bandwidth
.I rate
bytes.  If the specified bandwidth is exceeded, labrea will still
tarpit the incoming connection (ie respond SYN/ACK to incoming SYN).
.TP
.BR "-R --soft-restart"
New captures will be held off for 5 minutes to let bandwidth
calculations progress. If a major scan hits just after startup, this
prevents labrea from capturing too many connections.
.TP
.BR "-r --arp-timeout " \fIrate\fR
Wait
.I rate
seconds after seeing incoming arp requests
before capturing an IP address.
.TP
.BR "-s --switch-safe"
When there is an incoming ARP request, specifies that labrea should
send out an ARP request of its own for the same IP address. This is
necessary for safe operation in a switched environment where one host
does not necessarily see all the traffic on the switch.
.TP
.BR "-h --hard-capture "
Once an IP address has been captured, then do not wait for a "-r"
timeout for the next incoming ARP request.
.TP
.BR "-x --disable-capture"
Do not capture IPs.
.TP
.BR "-X --exclude-resolvable-ips"
On startup, attempt DNS resolution on all IPs within
the capture netblock. Automatically exclude any IP that has a
corresponding entry in the DNS. Be careful because this can generate a
lot of DNS lookups if the capture subnet is large.
.TP
.BR "-P --persist-mode-only"
Try to limit bandwidth use by doing only persist capturing. Note: This
parameter has limited usefulness since below max b/w, the same
exchange that leads to persist capture also has the side effect
of tarpitting.
.TP
.BR "-a --no-resp-synack"
By default, the LaBrea virtual hosts respond to SYN/ACK with RST, and
answer Pings. Disables this behaviour.
.TP
.BR "-H --auto-hard-capture"
Mark all non-excluded and all non-hardexcluded IPs as being hard
captured. See 
.B labrea.conf(5)
for more information. This parameter should be used
.I with caution.
.TP
.BR "-f --no-resp-excluded-ports"
Drop incoming connections to excluded ports. Normal default behaviour
is to return a RST. Makes nmap-style scanning go much slower.
.TP
.BR "--no-arp-sweep"
On startup, labrea sweeps the capture subnet with bursts of ARP
requests in an attempt to locate all live machines. This parameter
disables the sweep.
.TP
.BR "--init-file " \fIfile\fR
Read the configuration from the specified
.I file
instead of from the default location.
.TP
.BR "-F --bpf-file " \fIfile\fR
Designates the name of a file containing a BPF filter pointing to
machines/ports to be tarpitted.  As with the command line BPF filter,
these connections MUST be firewalled to DROP inbound traffic.
.TP
.BR "-T --dry-run"
Do labrea initialization, including Dns excludes, parse of the
configuration file, opening the network interface etc. Print
diagnostic information, then exit.
.TP
.BR "-d --foreground"
Do not detach the process. (Unix systems only)
.TP
.BR "-o --log-to-stdout"
Send log information to stdout rather than to syslog.  This option
also implies and sets the -d option (i.e. do not detach process).
.TP
.BR "-O --log-timestamp-epoch"
Same as the "-o" option, but with time output in seconds since epoch
to make it easier for logfile analysis programs.
.TP
.BR "-l --log-to-syslog"
Send log messages to syslog.
.TP
.BR "-b --log-bandwidth"
Log a message every minute detailing the current bandwidth consumption
of the -p option (persist capture).
.TP
.BR "-v --verbose"
Increase the verbosity of log messages. Use twice for more effect.
.TP
.BR "-q --quiet"
Do not report arp requests for IPs that are not in the capture
subnet.
.TP
.BR "-z --no-nag"
Turn off the nag message. Before you do this, read the basic warning
in the Notes section just below.
.TP
.BR "-? --usage --help"
Print a help message and then exit.
.TP
.BR "-V --version"
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.BR "-I --ip-addr " \fInnn.nnn.nnn.nnn\fR
Manually specify the IP address for the labrea server.
.TP
.BR "-E --my-mac-addr " \fIxx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\fR
Manually specify the MAC address of the labrea server's NIC.
.TP
.BR "-D --list-interfaces"
On Windows systems, print the list of WinPcap devices, followed by the
list of the libdnet interfaces. Note that each API has a different
nomenclature for the underlying NIC.
.TP
.BR "-j --winpcap-dev " \fInn\fR
On windows systems, select the nth winpcap device in the list.
.SH NOTES
.SS Basic Warning about use of labrea
.I You must understand this:
As a default, LaBrea captures IP addresses by creating a "virtual
machine" that sits on any UNUSED IP address that it sees. labrea has
been carefully written and tested to transparently and peacefully
operate in normal production environments but ...
.LP
.I There is a potential for problems
if someone decides to start using one of the IP addresses that
labrea has laid claim to, or if labrea erroneously decides that an IP
address is free when in fact a real machine is already there.
.SS Built-in protections
labrea tries very hard to NEVER capture an IP that has a live machine
sitting on it.
.LP
The following automatic mechanisms are provided:
.RS
.IP \(bu 
If labrea sees a gratuitous ARP signalling the arrival of a new
machine, it marks the corresponding IP address as excluded. ("new kids
on the block" logic)
.IP \(bu
Each ARP response is noted and the corresponding IP address is
marked as excluded.
.IP \(bu
At startup, a systematic sweep is done of the entire capture subnet
(as long as the subnet is not too big). All IP addresses that respond
are marked as excluded.
.RE
.LP
Then there are ways of manually specifying the exclusion of certain
addresses, and otherwise ensuring safe operation:
.RS
.IP \(bu
The EXC config stmt allows specified IP addresses to be manually
excluded from capture.
.IP \(bu
The IPI config stmt causes packets with the specified IP source
address(es) to be ignored.
.IP \(bu
-s --switch-safe parameter causes mirroring of ARP requests in a
switched environment
.IP \(bu
-X --exclude-resolvable-ips says to exclude all IPs that have a
corresponding Dns entry
.RE
.LP
.B Traffic rerouting:
Despite all this, if labrea somehow receives traffic whose IP
destination address belongs to a live machine, labrea will reroute
that traffic to the real machine.
.SS Size of the capture subnet
.LP
It is best to limit the capture subnet to the
.I actual physical segment
(VLAN, hub) where labrea is running.
.LP
In some configurations, where
proxy arp is being used to determine routing, interface subnet masks
can be quite large. (i.e. the "whole" network is "directly" attached to
the physical segment). 
.LP
In this case, if labrea picks up the subnet mask from the interface,
then labrea will inefficiently watch addresses that it has no hope of
capturing. You should use the -m / -n parameters to manually limit the
size of the capture subnet.
.SS Other usage notes
.HP
The labrea virtual machines use a bogus MAC address of 0:0:f:ff:ff:ff
.HP
On certain older Windows systems, it may be necessary to manually
specify the capture subnet.
.HP
On unix systems, KILL -USR1 will toggle logging off on and off.
.HP
On unix systems, KILL -HUP will cause labrea to reinitialize (and thus
free captured IPs).
.HP
If the capture subnet is too large (greater than 1024 addresses), then
labrea will not do an arp sweep.
.SH BUGS
.HP
On some systems, if there is absolutely no traffic to sniff,
pcap_dispatch will wait instead of timing out, making the program seem
unresponsive. (Workaround: ping the labrea server to "wake" it up.)
.HP
If --exclude-resolvable-ips is enabled, and if the capture subnet is
large (say class A /8), then a LOT of traffic will be generated to the
Dns server.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP 1)
Run safely in a switched environment with very verbose logging. Don't
respond to excluded ports. Log bandwidth usage from persist
capturing. Exclude all IPs that are in the Dns. Run in the foreground,
and log to stdout. Maximum capture bandwidth is 2 MB/sec. Use
toto.conf as the initialisation file. Use network device "eth1"
instead of the default device. Do a test run only - parse input,
initialize, then exit.
