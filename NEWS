2.5-stable-1
	-Mostly just 2.5-beta-2 all over again

	-Small change to utils.c rtn to fix compile error under windows.

2.5-beta-2
	-This is the release where we changed the cmd line parameters
        (again -( ).
	
	-Unit tested on Win2K, Win98, linux, FreeBSD, Solaris

	-Add support for libdnet-1.7. Since libdnet's API is cleaner,
	lbio became simpler (good). But the "-i" parameter in windows
	now is standard, and the -j parameter now refers to the
	WinPcap device. Sorry about this change.

	-There was an integer overflow problem that had to be dealt
	with. At the same time, we decided to change --max-rate (-p)
	parameter to assume input is in units of Kbits to avoid
	dealing with large bandwidths expressed in bytes. Keep
	internal totals in KByte units. Set an upper limit on max-rate
	to avoid integer overflows during calculations. Upper limit is
	currently 1 GByte/sec = 8 Gbits/sec. Sorry if this change
	causes inconvenience.

	-Corrected problem with timer pop so that bandwidth usage will
	be reported. Certain OSs were not working properly.


2.5-beta-1
	- Unit tested on Win98, WinME, WinXP, linux, OpenBSD, Solaris

	- Added debugging support. Has to be compiled into the pgm via
          ./configure --enable-debug. Then is controlled with cmd line
          --debug parameter.

2.5-alpha-1
	- Add support for automake, autoconf

	- Make code depend on libdnet. Use libdnet defines throughout
          the code.

	- (dynamic firewall ports) If ports are firewalled (ie no
	RST), then activity above a certain threshold will make a port
	start to respond.

	- The firewall code now checks the dest port on all incoming
          TCP packets.

	- Filter changed to make pgm will only hear packets *sent* to
	the bogus MAC address instead of all packets.

	- Responses will seem to come from the bogus virtual machine
	instead of the actual MAC address of the labrea server.

	- (arp sweeps) Pgm does an arp sweep of the capture subnet to
	try to locate live machines. A new parameter was added to turn
	this behaviour off if desired. For the arp sweep to happen,
	the capture subnet must be a "reasonable" size. Arps are sent
	out in batches of 80 at a time, at 1 - 2 minute intervals.

	- Pgm now takes notes of replies to Arp WHO-HAS and will leave
          these addresses alone (ie "new kid").

	- The "new kids on the block" logic was converted to use an
          array instead of a linked list. This should speed up the pgm
          and simplify the logic at the expense of storage. The "new
          kids" culling logic was moved into the timer signal handler
          code so that the new kid list is run at regular intervals
          but not at each arp.

	- The persistent connection logic was changed (newthisminute)
          so that the decision is made based on b/w and not just
          number of connections.
	
	- Test mode now logs on sysout. Test mode will not fork a
	child.

	- Pgm accepts long options at invocation (ie
          "--my-option"). Usage function was modified to show the long
          options.

	- Pgm will attempt to parse all input before bailing out.

	- Pcap_dispatch is used instead of Pcap_loop. This makes the
	pgm more efficient but less responsive to signals on certain
	operating systems.

	- "-m" parameter is still supported but "-n" can understand a
	CIDR format IP address (ie xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/nn)

	- Catastrophic execution error messages go to std
	error. (warnx)

	- Old style config files are no longer supported.

	- "PMN" directive added to config file to force a port to be
          monitored.

	- IPI config statement was changed to be in CIDR notation
          (xx.xx.xx.xx/nn). The IP ignore list is now a linked list of
          libdnet addr structures.

	- Pgm logic was restructured. Globals were mostly moved into
          static structures. Enums were used instead of defines. Some
          #ifdefs were replaced by conditional statements. Message
          strings were moved back into the main code. Externs and
          gotos were eliminated. queue.h support was used for linked
          lists.

	- Signal handling was changed to set a flag only. Signal
          processing logic is driven by this flag off the mainline
          loop.

	- Logging to syslog starts after the pgm's initialisation is
          completed.

	- Added utility print function to centralize all messages and
          logging.

	- bget functions used for dynamic memory allocation. Runs
          faster than native support on some operating systems.

	  *** Windows-specific ***

	- Windows version was developed on Cygwin / Mingw. Autoconf
          support was added for Windows.

	- Syslog support for Windows Event file as well as logging to
          a remote syslog daemon now works. If remote syslog doesn't
          work, then fails over to local event log. On Win98 / WinME,
          an attempt to log to the non-existent local event log causes
          an error message.

	- Remote syslog code (which was shamelessly borrowed from
          snort) was modified to open the socket (with possible
          accompanying DNS search) once at pgm startup, instead of for
          each new message.

	- A new parameter "-j" was added to select the WinPcap
          driver. The libdnet intf rtns support "-i" as is the case
          under Unix. The libdnet rtns are used to determine interface
          Mac and IP addresses.

	- A new parameter "-D" allows the user to obtain a display of
          all the libdnet and WinPcap devices. The display also shows
          the default devices.

	- On Windows, by default logging is to stdout, not syslog.
